/**
 * Pacote que contém a classe principal de testes.
 * 
 * Use the plural for packages with homogeneous contents and the singular for
 * packages with heterogeneous contents.
 * 
 * A class is similar to a database relation. A database relation should be
 * named in the singular as its records are considered to be instances of the
 * relation. The function of a relation is to compose a complex record from
 * simple data.
 * 
 * A package, on the other hand, is not a data abstraction. It assists with
 * organization of code and resolution of naming conflicts. If a package is
 * named in the singular, it doesn't mean that each member of the package is an
 * instance of the package; it contains related but heterogeneous concepts. If
 * it is named in the plural (as they often are), I would expect that the
 * package contains homogeneous concepts.
 * 
 * For example, a type should be named "TaskCollection" instead of
 * "TasksCollection," as it is a collection containing instances of a Task. A
 * package named com.myproject.task does not mean that each contained class is
 * an instance of a task. There might be a TaskHandler, a TaskFactory, etc. A
 * package named com.myproject.tasks, however, would contain different types
 * that are all tasks: TakeOutGarbageTask, DoTheDishesTask, etc.

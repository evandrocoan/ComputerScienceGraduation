# @param k       , the k'th Chebyshev Polynom
# @param t       , the value to evaluate at the k'th Chebyshev Polynom
# @param sequence, 0 or 1 to indicate the current `t`'s Chebyshev Polynom sequence.
#                  For example, to calculate the `t` = 0.6's Chebyshev Polynoms, use the
#                  `sequence` as 0.
#                  And later when calculating the Chebyshev Polynom for `t` = 0.4, set this
#                  value to 1, to clear the last Chebyshev Polynom cached values for `t` = 0.6.

function result = getChebyshevCoefficientsByPolinom( k, t )

    polynom = getChebyshevCoefficientsPolinom( k );
